# Logical View (Object Oriented Decomposition)
>This view focuses on realizing an application’s functionality in terms of structural key elements, key abstractions and mechanisms, separation of concerns and distribution of responsibilities.
>- Vertical and horizontal divisions The application can be vertically divided into significant functional areas (i.e., order capture subsystems, order processing subsystems).
>Or, it can be horizontally divided into a layered architecture distributing responsibilities among these layers (i.e., presentation layers, services layers, business logic layers, and data access layers).

>- Representation of structural elements as classes or objects and their relationships.
