# Logical View (Object Oriented Decomposition)
>This view focuses on realizing an application’s functionality in terms of structural key elements, key abstractions and mechanisms, separation of concerns and distribution of responsibilities.
>- Vertical and horizontal divisions The application can be vertically divided into significant functional areas (i.e., order capture subsystems, order processing subsystems).
>Or, it can be horizontally divided into a layered architecture distributing responsibilities among these layers (i.e., presentation layers, services layers, business logic layers, and data access layers).

>- Representation of structural elements as classes or objects and their relationships.

## Design Concepts
- Object

- Roles

- Responsibilities and Collaborations

- Relationships

- Principles

- Patterns

### Designing  the application using several complementary perspectives
- An Application
	- Set of interacting Objects
- An Obejct
	- An Implementation of One or More Roles
- A Role
	- A Set of Related Responsibilities
- A Responsibility
	-  an obligation to perform a task or know information
- A Collaboration
	- an interaction of objects or roles (or both)
- A Contract
	- an agreement outlining the terms of a collaboration

### Object design
![Object Machinary](https://github.com/venu-shastri/ooad-uml-knowledge/blob/master/images/Object_machinary.JPG)

We separate an object's design into Four parts

- Data Define its Public Interface

- The terms and Conditions of  Use

- The Private Details – how it conduct its bussiness



>"The object has three properties, which makes it a simple, yet powerful model building block. It has state so it can model memory. It has behavior, so that it can model dynamic processes. And it is encapsulated, so that it can hide complexity."
