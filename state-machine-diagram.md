# State Machine (StateChart) Diagram
**A  state machine diagram  models the behavior of a single object, specifying the sequence of events that an object goes through during its lifetime in response to events**
>These are very useful to describe the behavior of objects that act differently according to the state they are in at the moment

- The main elements that state diagrams depict are **states** and **transitions**. States are captured by rectangles with rounded corners that are labeled with the name of the the state. Transitions are marked with arrows that flow from one state to another, showing how the states change.
- Each state diagram typically begins with a **dark circle that indicates the initial state** and **ends with a bordered circle that denotes the final state**. Sometimes, the Final State is not used.
