# Component Diagram
>Component diagrams are representative of a set of **`components`** and their relationships. The components present in these types of diagrams consist of classes, interfaces or collaborations. So such diagrams offer the **`implementation view`** of the system. During the design phase, software artifacts of the system are placed in various groups based on their relationship to each other. These groups are called components and are basically used to visualize the implementation process.
