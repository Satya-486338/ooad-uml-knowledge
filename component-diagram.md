# Component Diagram
>Component diagrams are representative of a set of **`components`** and their relationships. The components present in these types of diagrams consist of classes, interfaces or collaborations. So such diagrams offer the **`implementation view`** of the system. During the design phase, software artifacts of the system are placed in various groups based on their relationship to each other. These groups are called components and are basically used to visualize the implementation process.
The components can be a software component such as a **database or
user interface; or a hardware component such as a circuit, microchip or
device; or a business unit such as supplier, payroll or shipping**.

## Component Diagram Symbols

### Component
#### There are three ways the component symbol can be used.

### Provided Interface and the Required Interface
Interfaces in component diagrams show how components are **`wired `together
and interact with each other. The assembly connector allows linking the
componentâ€™s required interface (represented with a semi-circle and a solid
line) with the provided interface (represented with a circle and solid line) of
another component. This shows that one component is providing the service
that the other is requiring
